# WebRTC Video Calling Application

This project is a WebRTC-based video calling application where users can log in with their email ID and join a room using a room number. Once users join the same room, they can initiate a video call, allowing them to communicate with each other in real-time.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users log in using their email ID.
- **Room Access:** Users join a room by entering a unique room number.
- **Video Calling:** Once in the same room, users can initiate a video call.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Video and audio communication using WebRTC.
- **Camera & Microphone Access:** The application requests access to the user's camera and microphone for the video call.

## How It Works

1. **Login:**
   - Users enter their email ID to log in.
   - The user is prompted to enter a room number.

2. **Room Joining:**
   - Users join a room by entering a room number.
   - Multiple users can join the same room using the same room number.

3. **Video Calling:**
   - Once in the room, users can initiate a video call by selecting the calling option.
   - The application requests permission to access the user's camera and microphone.
   - Upon granting access, a video call is established, allowing users to communicate in real-time.
